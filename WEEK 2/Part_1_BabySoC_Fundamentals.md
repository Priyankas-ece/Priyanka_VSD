# BabySoC Fundamentals & Functional Modelling

## Objective 
- The goal of this week’s task is to develop a strong understanding of **System-on-Chip (SoC) fundamentals** and to gain hands-on experience in **functional modelling** of the BabySoC design using open-source simulation tools such as **Icarus Verilog** and **GTKWave**.
- This forms the foundation for deeper exploration into **RTL design, synthesis, and physical design** in later stages of the SoC learning journey.

## 1. What is a System-on-Chip (SoC)?  
A **System-on-Chip (SoC)** is a highly integrated circuit that combines the essential building blocks of a complete electronic system into a **single chip**. Instead of having multiple discrete components like processor ICs, memory ICs, and peripheral controllers, an SoC consolidates them all together.  
An SoC is not just a CPU—it is a complete system containing processing, storage, communication, and control logic, all on a single silicon die.

### Key Characteristics of SoCs:
- **Integration** – CPU, memory, and peripherals on one chip.  
- **Compactness** – Smaller form factor compared to multi-chip systems.  
- **Energy Efficiency** – Optimized for low power consumption.  
- **Performance** – High bandwidth and fast communication via internal buses.  
- **Applications** – Smartphones, IoT devices, automotive controllers, embedded electronics, etc.  

## 2. Components of a Typical SoC  
According to the fundamentals of SoC design notes, a typical SoC consists of:  

1. **CPU/Core (Processing Unit)**  
   - Executes instructions and performs arithmetic/logic operations.  
   - Often includes instruction fetch, decode, execute, and write-back stages.  

2. **Memory Subsystem**  
   - **Volatile memory (SRAM, DRAM)** for instructions/data during execution.  
   - **Non-volatile memory (Flash, ROM)** for program storage.  

3. **Peripherals**  
   - Interfaces to the external world: UART, SPI, I2C, GPIO, timers, ADC/DAC.  
   - Enable communication with sensors, actuators, and other ICs.  

4. **Interconnect / Bus Fabric**  
   - The communication backbone that transfers data between CPU, memory, and peripherals.  
   - Examples: **AMBA (AXI, AHB, APB)** bus standards.  

5. **Additional IP Blocks**  
   - Power management units, PLL/clock circuits.  
   - Optional hardware accelerators (DSP, GPU, ML cores).  

## 3. Why BabySoC?  
The **BabySoC** is a simplified learning model of a real-world SoC. Its design is intentionally kept minimal to help learners:  

- Focus on **concepts** rather than overwhelming complexity.  
- Understand the **basic building blocks** (CPU, memory, interconnect, peripherals).  
- Gain experience with **simulation and debugging** in a controlled environment.  
- Build confidence before moving toward **full-scale SoC development**.  

## 4. Role of Functional Modelling  
Before moving to RTL design and physical implementation, engineers build **functional models** of the SoC.  

### Why Functional Modelling?
- Ensures the **design behaves correctly** at a conceptual level.  
- Helps validate the **data flow and interactions** between components.  
- Allows **early debugging** of architectural mistakes.  
- Saves time and cost by catching errors before expensive implementation stages.  

### Tools Used:
- **Icarus Verilog** – Open-source Verilog simulation tool.  
- **GTKWave** – Waveform viewer for debugging simulation results.  

With these tools, we can:  
- Write and run testbenches.  
- Verify signal activity.  
- Analyze behavior of BabySoC components at an early stage.
